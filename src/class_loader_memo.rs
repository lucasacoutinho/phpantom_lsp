//! [`Backend`]: crate::Backend
//!
//! The diagnostic pass asks for the same classes over and over: one
//! `analyze` run on a large Laravel project makes ~3.7 M name → class
//! lookups over a few thousand distinct types. Every one of them walked the
//! multi-phase loader in `resolution.rs`, hashing the name
//! case-insensitively for a read lock on `class_not_found_cache` and
//! another on `fqn_class_index`. With one worker per core those two lock
//! words were the pass's ceiling: the loader and the lock and hash code
//! under it were ~22% of its samples, ~7% of that spent purely acquiring
//! the read locks.
//!
//! Interned [`PhpType`] handles are a far cheaper key than the name: one
//! multiply to index a slot, then pointer equality. A repeat lookup
//! touches nothing but this thread's own table.
//!
//! # Freshness
//!
//! A slot is served only while its stamp matches
//! [`SymbolIndex::class_lookup_generation`], which
//! [`SymbolIndex::note_class_lookup_change`] bumps on every mutation of
//! `fqn_class_index` and every clear of `class_not_found_cache`. Those are
//! the two structures a loader answer is derived from, so a memoised
//! answer is never staler than the caches it came from. Retired slots are
//! overwritten in place rather than swept, so invalidation costs nothing.
//! Each slot also records the current Composer analysis-context identity,
//! preventing a worker reused for sibling projects from serving one
//! project's same-FQN class to another.

//! # Why a fixed table
//!
//! Memory is bounded with no eviction policy to tune: `SLOTS` entries per
//! thread that ever looks a class up, holding one type handle and one
//! `Arc<ClassInfo>` each — both already kept alive by the interner and the
//! class index. A long-lived server cannot grow it, and a collision costs
//! one recomputation.
//!
//! # Why per-thread
//!
//! A shared table would reintroduce the lock this memo exists to avoid.
//! Threads are not the unit of ownership, though, so each slot records
//! which [`SymbolIndex`] produced it: a thread reused across `Backend`s
//! (nextest runs many in one process) cannot be served another project's
//! classes.
